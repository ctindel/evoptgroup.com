# Insurance & Payment Information
## We Make Quality Care Accessible

At Evo PT Group, we believe everyone deserves access to exceptional physical therapy care. That's why we accept most major insurance plans, Medicare, and offer flexible payment options to fit your needs and budget.

## Insurance Coverage

### We Accept Major Insurance Plans
We're in-network with the following insurance providers:

- **Medicare** — Full Part B coverage
- **Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS)**
- **Aetna**
- **OPTUM/United Healthcare (UHC)**
- **ASH/Cigna**
- **OneCall** — Workers' compensation
- **MedRisk** — Workers' compensation

**Don't see your insurance listed?** Call us at (469) 825-3900 — we can work with your plan as an out-of-network provider and help you maximize your benefits.

### How Insurance Coverage Works

#### Before Your First Visit
- **We verify your benefits** to understand your coverage
- **Clear explanation** of any copays, deductibles, or coinsurance
- **Pre-authorization** handled when required
- **No surprises** — you'll know your costs upfront

#### During Treatment
- We bill your insurance directly
- You pay only your copay or coinsurance at time of service
- We handle all the paperwork
- Regular updates on your remaining benefits

### Medicare Patients Welcome

- Full Medicare Part B coverage for physical therapy
- No referral needed in most cases

## HSA & FSA

Physical therapy is a qualified medical expense for both HSA and FSA accounts. We provide:
- All necessary documentation for reimbursement
- Direct HSA/FSA card payment accepted
- Detailed receipts for your records

## Out-of-Network Benefits

If we're not in-network with your insurance, you may still have coverage:

### Superbill Service
We provide detailed superbills containing:
- Provider information and NPI number
- CPT codes for services rendered
- ICD-10 diagnosis codes
- All information needed for reimbursement

### Typical Reimbursement
Many patients with out-of-network benefits recover 40-80% of costs, depending on their plan.

### How to Check Your Out-of-Network Benefits
Call your insurance and ask:
1. "What are my out-of-network physical therapy benefits?"
2. "What is my out-of-network deductible?"
3. "What percentage does my plan reimburse?"
4. "Is there a visit limit for physical therapy?"

## Financial Policies

### Payment Due
- **Insurance patients**: Copay/coinsurance due at time of service
- **Self-pay patients**: Payment due at time of service unless payment plan arranged
- **Accepted payment methods**: Cash, check, all major credit cards, HSA/FSA cards

### Good Faith Estimate
Under the No Surprises Act, you have the right to receive a Good Faith Estimate for the total expected cost of non-emergency medical services. We provide this automatically for all self-pay patients.

### Cancellation Policy
- 24-hour notice required for cancellations
- Late cancellations may be subject to a fee
- Insurance may not cover missed appointment fees

- **Ask about payment plans** — we offer flexible options

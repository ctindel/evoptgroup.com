Dr. Preston Arnold isn't your typical physical therapist. As a former collegiate baseball player who experienced firsthand the frustration of injury and inadequate guidance, Preston transformed his setback into a mission: helping others train, recover, and perform the right way.

## From Athlete to Advocate

Preston's journey into physical therapy began on the baseball diamond. A preventable injury—caused by training without proper guidance—nearly derailed his athletic career. That experience ignited a passion to understand how the body truly works and how to optimize human performance safely.

Today, as a Doctor of Physical Therapy and certified strength coach, Preston brings both personal experience and clinical expertise to every session. He doesn't just prescribe exercises from the sidelines—he lives the lifestyle he teaches, regularly challenging himself through strength training and endurance sports.

# Recovery & Wellness Services
## Optimize Recovery, Maximize Performance

At Evo PT Group, we understand that recovery isn't just rest—it's an active process that accelerates healing, prevents injury, and enhances performance. Our recovery services help you bounce back faster and stronger.

## Recovery Services

Our cupping therapy combines traditional wisdom with modern application to accelerate your recovery. Using both static and dynamic cupping techniques, we increase blood flow to tired muscles, release fascial restrictions that limit movement, and reduce the muscle tension that builds from training and daily life. Athletes particularly value how cupping accelerates recovery between training sessions while decreasing pain and inflammation without the side effects of medication.

Soft tissue mobilization goes far beyond basic massage. Our expert manual therapy encompasses deep tissue work to address chronic tension, myofascial release to restore tissue pliability, and targeted trigger point therapy for those stubborn knots that refer pain throughout your body. We're equally skilled at scar tissue mobilization to restore normal tissue mobility after surgery or injury, providing comprehensive muscle tension relief that helps you move and feel better.

Instrument-Assisted Soft Tissue Mobilization (IASTM) adds another dimension to our recovery services. Using specialized stainless steel tools, we can break up scar tissue more effectively than hands alone, improve tissue mobility in chronically tight areas, and stimulate a healing response in stubborn tendinopathies. This technique excels at reducing chronic tension patterns and restoring the normal movement between tissue layers that's essential for pain-free function.

Movement and mobility work forms the foundation of sustainable recovery. We develop comprehensive programs featuring dynamic stretching routines tailored to your activities, joint mobility exercises that maintain healthy range of motion, and flexibility enhancement that goes beyond static stretching. Every program includes movement pattern correction to ensure you're not just mobile but moving efficiently, plus daily mobility practices you can perform independently to maintain the gains we achieve together.

Education empowers you to take control of your recovery. We teach you how to optimize sleep for tissue repair and nervous system recovery, understand nutrition's role in the recovery process, and implement proper hydration protocols that go beyond just drinking water. You'll learn stress management techniques that complement physical recovery and discover active recovery methods that accelerate healing without adding training stress.

## Wellness Programs

Our injury prevention screening catches problems before they sideline you. Through comprehensive movement analysis, we identify the subtle compensations and imbalances that predispose you to injury. This isn't just about finding problems—it's about developing customized prevention strategies based on your specific risk factors. Regular reassessments ensure your prevention program evolves with your training, while simultaneously optimizing your performance by addressing limiting factors you might not even know exist.

Maintenance programs provide the consistency needed for long-term success. Think of it as routine maintenance for your body—monthly wellness sessions that keep you moving optimally, ongoing injury prevention that adapts to your changing needs, and performance maintenance that ensures you don't lose what you've worked so hard to gain. Through consistent progress monitoring, we catch small issues before they become big problems, all with a long-term health focus that keeps you active for life.

Our corporate wellness services (coming soon) will bring injury prevention directly to the workplace. We'll provide on-site assessments and treatment, ergonomic evaluations to reduce workplace injuries, and group wellness sessions that build team camaraderie while improving health. Lunch-and-learn presentations will educate employees on injury prevention and self-care, forming comprehensive employee health programs that reduce healthcare costs while improving productivity and morale.

## Who Benefits from Recovery Services?

Athletes in season face unique challenges that our recovery services address perfectly. The grueling demands of competition require strategies to maintain performance when your body wants to break down. We help you prevent the overuse injuries that plague mid-season athletes, optimize recovery between games when time is limited, and address those minor aches before they become major problems that end your season early.

Active adults often struggle with the balance between pushing hard enough to see results and recovering adequately to stay consistent. Our services help you manage the workout soreness that can derail your routine, improve the flexibility and mobility that naturally decline with age, and prevent the age-related stiffness that makes getting out of bed feel like a workout itself. Most importantly, we help you maintain the active lifestyle that defines who you are.

Clients who've completed formal physical therapy often find themselves in limbo—better than they were but not where they want to be. Our recovery services provide the bridge to continue your progress, implement strategies to prevent re-injury, maintain the gains you worked so hard to achieve, and ultimately transition from rehabilitation to performance.

You don't need to be injured or an athlete to benefit from recovery services. Anyone seeking to reduce the stress and tension that modern life creates, improve their overall movement quality, enhance their quality of life, or simply invest in preventive care will find tremendous value in our wellness approach. Think of it as maintenance for your most important asset—your body.

## Recovery Packages

Our single session option provides 60 minutes of focused recovery work perfect for addressing immediate needs. Whether you're dealing with post-competition soreness, preparing for an important event, or just need some dedicated recovery time, these sessions deliver targeted relief while providing education for continued self-care between visits.

The Recovery Series offers the consistency needed for lasting change. Over four sessions scheduled weekly or bi-weekly based on your needs, we implement a progressive recovery plan that builds on each session's gains. This package provides the best of both worlds—structured progression at a discounted rate that makes regular care more accessible.

Our Athlete Maintenance program is designed for those who understand that recovery is not a luxury but a necessity. Monthly sessions provide ongoing support that adapts to your training cycles and competition schedule. With flexible scheduling to accommodate your busy life and priority booking that ensures you get the appointments you need, this program offers the best value for those committed to long-term health and performance.

## The Science of Recovery

Recovery isn't just about feeling better—it's about cellular regeneration, tissue remodeling, and systematic adaptation. Our evidence-based approach ensures every technique serves a purpose in your overall performance strategy.

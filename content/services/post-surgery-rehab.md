## Success Stories

"After my knee replacement, I was told I'd never run again. Dr. Arnold had other plans. Six months later, I completed a 5K. The difference? Personalized attention and a rehab plan that pushed me appropriately." - Michael, 62

"My ACL recovery was ahead of schedule at every surgeon check-up. The one-on-one attention made all the difference. No cookie-cutter protocols, just what I needed when I needed it." - Sarah, 28

"Following spine surgery, I was terrified to move. The education and progressive approach gave me confidence. I'm now more active than I was before surgery." - Robert, 54

## Pre-Surgery Preparation Available

Studies show that "pre-hab" before surgery leads to better outcomes. We offer pre-surgical programs to:
- Build strength before surgery

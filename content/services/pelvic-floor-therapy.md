# Pelvic Floor Therapy
## Restoring Core Function from the Foundation Up

Your pelvic floor is the foundation of your core—a group of muscles that support your bladder, bowel, and reproductive organs. When these muscles aren't functioning properly, it can affect everything from athletic performance to daily comfort. At Evo PT Group, we provide specialized, evidence-based pelvic floor therapy for both men and women.

## Understanding Pelvic Floor Dysfunction

Pelvic floor issues are more common than you think:
- **1 in 3 women** experience pelvic floor dysfunction
- **1 in 10 men** deal with pelvic floor issues
- **67% of women** have diastasis recti postpartum
- **50% of runners** experience stress incontinence

The good news? With proper treatment, these conditions are highly treatable.

## Conditions We Treat

Our pelvic floor therapy addresses a wide range of women's health conditions that too often go untreated. We help women overcome stress and urge incontinence, providing strategies that go far beyond "just do more Kegels." Pelvic organ prolapse and diastasis recti require specialized techniques we've mastered through extensive training. Whether you're dealing with pregnancy-related pain, navigating postpartum recovery, experiencing painful intercourse, managing endometriosis pain, or preparing for or recovering from gynecological surgery, we provide compassionate, effective care that addresses both the physical and emotional aspects of these conditions.

Men's pelvic health issues are often overlooked but equally important. We specialize in treating post-prostatectomy incontinence, helping men regain control and confidence after prostate surgery. Chronic pelvic pain in men requires a different approach than in women, and we understand these nuances. We also address athletic pubalgia (sports hernias), core weakness that contributes to back pain, and provide comprehensive post-surgical rehabilitation for various male pelvic surgeries.

Athletes face unique pelvic floor challenges that can significantly impact performance. Core stability issues often stem from pelvic floor dysfunction, creating a weak link in the kinetic chain. Hip dysfunction frequently connects to pelvic floor problems, as these structures work together for stability and power. We help runners overcome exercise-induced incontinence that affects up to 50% of female runners, guide new mothers through safe return to sport postpartum, and address breathing dysfunction that limits both pelvic floor function and athletic performance.

## Our Pelvic Floor Approach

Every successful pelvic floor treatment begins with truly understanding your unique situation. Our comprehensive assessment starts with a detailed medical history that helps us understand not just your symptoms but the full context of your condition. We conduct thorough movement screening to identify compensatory patterns, test core strength in multiple positions and planes, assess your breathing patterns (which directly impact pelvic floor function), evaluate your posture for contributing factors, and analyze functional movements specific to your daily activities and goals.

Our treatment combines multiple evidence-based approaches for optimal results. Therapeutic exercises are carefully selected and progressed to address your specific dysfunctions without overwhelming sensitive tissues. Manual therapy techniques help release tension, improve tissue mobility, and restore normal muscle tone. We use biofeedback training to help you understand and control muscles you can't see, while breathing retraining restores the critical relationship between your diaphragm and pelvic floor. Core stabilization work goes beyond traditional exercises to integrate all components of your deep stability system, and functional movement training ensures these improvements translate to your daily life. Throughout treatment, we help you implement lifestyle modifications that support healing and prevent recurrence.

Education forms the cornerstone of lasting success. We take time to help you understand your anatomy and how your condition developed, explaining not just what's happening but why. You'll learn practical strategies to manage symptoms when they arise and prevention techniques to avoid future problems. Most importantly, we develop long-term wellness plans that keep you healthy and active well beyond your time in our clinic.

## What to Expect

Your first visit is a comprehensive 60-90 minute evaluation where we take the time to truly understand your condition. We'll discuss your symptoms in detail, along with your goals and what activities you want to return to. Our physical assessment is thorough yet respectful (external examination only at Evo PT), allowing us to gather the information needed to create your personalized treatment plan. You'll leave with a clear understanding of your condition and a home exercise program to begin your recovery immediately.

Treatment sessions provide 60 minutes of focused, one-on-one care. Each session combines hands-on manual therapy to address tissue restrictions and muscle tension with carefully selected therapeutic exercises that progress as you improve. We continuously monitor your progress, not just through formal testing but by listening to how you're feeling and functioning in daily life. Your program adjusts based on your response to treatment, ensuring we're always providing what you need most.

While everyone's timeline differs, most patients follow a predictable progression. In weeks 1-2, you'll develop better awareness and control of your pelvic floor muscles. By weeks 3-4, most people notice meaningful symptom improvement. Weeks 6-8 typically bring significant functional gains that translate to real-life activities. By weeks 10-12, most patients are returning to their desired activities with confidence and strategies for long-term success.

## Common Myths Debunked

**Myth: "Leaking is normal after having kids"**
Reality: Common doesn't mean normal. Incontinence is treatable at any stage.

**Myth: "Kegels fix everything"**
Reality: Many people do Kegels incorrectly, and some conditions require relaxation, not strengthening.

**Myth: "Surgery is the only option"**
Reality: 80% of pelvic floor issues improve significantly with conservative treatment.

**Myth: "It's too late to fix these issues"**
Reality: It's never too late to improve pelvic floor function.

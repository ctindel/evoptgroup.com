# Pelvic Floor Therapy
## Restoring Core Function from the Foundation Up

Your pelvic floor is the foundation of your coreâ€”a group of muscles that support your bladder, bowel, and reproductive organs. When these muscles aren't functioning properly, it can affect everything from athletic performance to daily comfort. At Evo PT Group, we provide specialized, evidence-based pelvic floor therapy for both men and women.

Reality: 80% of pelvic floor issues improve significantly with conservative treatment.

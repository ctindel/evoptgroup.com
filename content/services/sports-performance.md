# Sports Performance Training
## Train Like an Athlete, Perform Like a Champion

Whether you're a competitive athlete or someone who simply wants to move better, our performance training programs are designed to elevate your capabilities and keep you injury-free.

## Who We Train

Our performance training serves a diverse community of movement enthusiasts. We work with competitive athletes at every level, from high school stars preparing for college recruitment to professional and semi-professional competitors maintaining their edge. Weekend warriors and recreational athletes find our programs equally valuable, as do CrossFit devotees, hybrid athletes juggling multiple disciplines, and endurance athletes including runners, cyclists, and triathletes looking to enhance their performance while staying injury-free.

You don't need to be a competitive athlete to benefit from performance training. Active adults make up a significant portion of our clientele, including fitness enthusiasts looking to break through plateaus, former athletes who refuse to let their glory days define their fitness ceiling, and adults new to training who want to do it right from the start. Whether you're seeking functional fitness for daily life or simply want to move better in everything you do, our programs adapt to meet you where you are and take you where you want to go.

## Performance Training Services

Athletic performance enhancement forms the core of what we do. We develop the physical qualities that separate good athletes from great ones through comprehensive speed and agility development, power and explosiveness training that translates directly to your sport, and sport-specific skill development that bridges the gap between the weight room and the field. Our programs sharpen reaction time and coordination while providing structured competition preparation that ensures you peak when it matters most.

Our strength and conditioning programs go beyond simply adding weight to the bar. We implement progressive strength programming based on scientific principles, teach proper Olympic lifting technique for explosive power development, and cover powerlifting fundamentals for those seeking maximum strength. Every program emphasizes functional movement patterns that transfer to real-world performance, all structured within periodized training plans that optimize adaptation while preventing burnout.

Injury prevention isn't an afterthoughtâ€”it's woven into everything we do. Through comprehensive movement screening and biomechanical assessment, we identify potential issues before they become injuries. Our corrective exercise programming addresses these weak links while our load management strategies ensure you're training hard enough to improve but smart enough to stay healthy. We optimize recovery because we understand that you don't get stronger during training; you get stronger recovering from training.

For athletes returning from injury, we provide the crucial bridge between medical clearance and competitive readiness. Our post-injury reconditioning follows graduated return protocols based on the latest research, incorporating sport-specific testing to ensure you're truly ready. We focus equally on confidence rebuilding and performance restoration, because returning to sport is as much mental as it is physical.

## Our Training Philosophy

Science guides every decision we make in your programming. We don't follow fads or rely on what worked for someone else. Instead, every program is built on proven principles including progressive overload to drive adaptation, specific training that matches your sport's demands, and individualized volume and intensity based on your training history and recovery capacity. Proper recovery integration ensures you're adapting optimally, while measurable outcomes keep us accountable to your progress.

Movement quality always takes precedence over load or intensity. We insist on mastering the basics before adding complexity because a foundation built on poor movement patterns will eventually crumble under heavy loads or high speeds. You'll learn to maintain perfect technique even under fatigue, build sustainable movement patterns that will serve you for decades, and understand how proper form is your best defense against injury.

### The Performance Pyramid

Your athletic development follows a logical progression. First, we establish **mobility** to ensure you can move through the full ranges of motion your sport demands. Next comes **stability**, teaching you to control that newfound mobility under load. With mobile, stable joints, we build **strength** as your performance foundation. That strength becomes **power** when we add speed to the equation. Finally, we integrate **sport skills** to ensure all these physical qualities translate to competitive excellence.

## Program Options

Our individual performance training provides the gold standard in athletic development. With one-on-one coaching, every session focuses entirely on your needs, your technique, and your goals. Your customized programming evolves based on your progress, with constant technique refinement ensuring you're not just training hard, but training smart. We track every aspect of your progress and offer flexible scheduling to fit your life, because consistency is key to transformation.

Small group training (coming soon) will offer the perfect blend of personalized attention and competitive atmosphere. Limited to 2-4 athletes per session, these sport-specific groups provide community support and friendly competition at a more accessible price point while maintaining the quality coaching Evo PT is known for.

For those who can't train with us in person, our remote programming brings Evo PT expertise to you wherever you are. You'll receive customized training plans designed specifically for your goals and available equipment, video analysis to refine your technique, and weekly check-ins to adjust programming as needed. Everything is delivered through our user-friendly app, giving you professional coaching in your pocket.

## Success Stories

James T., a high school basketball player, came to us with a dream of dunking before graduation. "Preston helped me increase my vertical jump by 6 inches and finally dunk!" he reports. His success came from a targeted program combining lower body power development with plyometric training specific to basketball.

Amanda S. exemplifies what focused training can achieve in CrossFit: "After working with Evo PT, I PRed in all my lifts and qualified for regionals." Her programming balanced the competing demands of strength, endurance, and skill work while keeping her healthy through a grueling competitive season.

Perhaps most inspiring is Robert K., who proves age is just a number: "I'm 55 and moving better than I did at 35. This program changed my life." His transformation shows that with proper programming and consistent effort, your best athletic years can be ahead of you, not behind you.

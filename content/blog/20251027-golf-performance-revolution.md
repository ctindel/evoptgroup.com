Golf looks gentle—until you realize you're rotating your spine at 100+ mph, generating forces up to 8 times your body weight, and doing it 70+ times per round. No wonder 80% of golfers experience back pain and the average golfer loses 5 yards of distance per decade after 30.

But here's what the golf industry doesn't want you to know: those expensive clubs won't fix your swing if your body can't move properly. The secret to more distance, better accuracy, and playing pain-free isn't in your bag—it's in your body.

## The Biomechanics Your Pro Never Taught You

### The Power Chain Reality
Power doesn't come from your arms. Here's the real sequence:
1. **Ground force** through feet
2. **Hip rotation** and loading
3. **Core transfer** of energy
4. **Thoracic spine** rotation
5. **Shoulder** stability
6. **Arms and club** (last, not first!)

Miss any link in this chain, and you lose power and risk injury.

### The Mobility Requirements
A proper golf swing demands:
- 45° hip internal rotation (trail hip)
- 60° hip external rotation (lead hip)
- 60° thoracic spine rotation
- 90° shoulder external rotation
- Full wrist flexibility

Most golfers have half these ranges. No wonder the ball doesn't go where you aim.

## The Big 5 Golf Injuries (And Their Real Causes)

### 1. Lower Back Pain
**What You Think:** "I twisted wrong"
**Real Cause:** Tight hips forcing excessive spine rotation
**The Fix:** Hip mobility, not back stretches

### 2. Golfer's Elbow
**What You Think:** "I need new clubs"
**Real Cause:** Gripping too hard due to weak forearms
**The Fix:** Grip strength training

### 3. Shoulder Impingement
**What You Think:** "Old injury acting up"
**Real Cause:** Poor thoracic mobility forcing shoulder overuse
**The Fix:** Mid-back mobility work

### 4. Knee Pain
**What You Think:** "Arthritis"
**Real Cause:** Poor weight shift and rotation mechanics
**The Fix:** Single-leg stability training

### 5. Wrist/Hand Issues
**What You Think:** "Impact stress"
**Real Cause:** Casting or early release compensation
**The Fix:** Wrist strengthening and swing sequencing

## The TPI Screen: Know Your Numbers

These tests reveal your golf body's limitations:

### Test 1: Pelvic Rotation
- Stand in golf posture
- Rotate pelvis without moving upper body
- Need: 45° each direction
- Fail = Back pain risk

### Test 2: Thoracic Spine Rotation
- Arms crossed, rotate upper body
- Need: 60° each way
- Fail = Shoulder/elbow issues

### Test 3: Single Leg Balance
- Stand on one leg, eyes closed
- Need: 30 seconds
- Fail = Inconsistent ball striking

### Test 4: Overhead Deep Squat
- Arms overhead, squat down
- Need: Thighs below parallel
- Fail = Power loss

### Test 5: 90/90 Shoulder Test
- Arms at 90°, rotate back
- Need: Hands behind body line
- Fail = Slice tendency

## Age-Specific Golf Fitness

### 30-40 Years: Maintain and Build
- Focus on power development
- Prevent early decline
- Build strength reserves
- Maintain flexibility

### 40-50 Years: Preserve and Protect
- Emphasize mobility work
- Core stability critical
- Recovery becomes priority
- Monitor form changes

### Post-Round Recovery:
- Protein within 30 minutes
- Anti-inflammatory foods
- Continue hydrating
- Avoid excess alcohol

## The Mental Game Physical Connection

Poor physical condition affects:
- Concentration (fatigue)

- Consistency (compensation)
- Enjoyment (frustration)

Better fitness provides:
- Sustained focus

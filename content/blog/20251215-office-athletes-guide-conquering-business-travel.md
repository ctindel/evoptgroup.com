Monday: Chicago. Tuesday: Dallas. Wednesday: Client dinner. Thursday: Red-eye to NYC. Friday: Collapse at home, order pizza, skip workout. Sound familiar? Business travel doesn't just wreck your fitness routine—it destroys your energy, productivity, and eventually, your career performance.

But what if I told you that road warriors who master travel fitness actually come back stronger? That hotel rooms can be better than gyms? That airports are secret training grounds? Let me show you how to turn business travel from fitness kryptonite into your competitive advantage.

## The Hidden Cost of Travel Decline

### What One Week of Travel Does to Your Body
- Muscle mass drops 2-3%
- Cardiovascular fitness decreases 5%
- Sleep debt accumulates 10+ hours
- Stress hormones elevated 40%
- Immune system compromised 30%
- Decision fatigue increases 50%

Multiply this by monthly travel? You're aging in dog years.

### The Executive Health Crisis
- 75% of executives are overweight
- 40% have high blood pressure
- 60% report chronic pain

- 90% sacrifice fitness for work

Your health is your wealth. Protect it.

Your body was designed to move, hunt, gather, and explore. Instead, it spends 8-10 hours daily in a position that would have horrified your ancestors: hunched over a glowing rectangle. The result? A epidemic of "desk worker syndrome"â€”that toxic combination of forward head posture, rounded shoulders, tight hips, and a core that's forgotten its job.

But here's the good news: you can undo most of the damage in just 15 minutes a day. No gym required. No equipment needed. Just smart, targeted movements that reset your body and prepare it for life outside the cubicle.

## The Sitting Crisis: What 8 Hours Does to Your Body

Let's get specific about what happens during your workday:

### Hour 1-2: The Slump Begins
- Hip flexors start shortening
- Glutes begin to "turn off"
- Shoulders round forward
- Neck cranes toward screen

### Hour 3-4: The Compensation Cascade
- Lower back takes over for weak glutes
- Upper traps overwork to hold head up
- Breathing becomes shallow
- Core goes dormant

### Hour 5-6: The Pain Patterns Emerge
- Lower back aches
- Neck tension builds
- Shoulders feel like rocks
- Hip flexors cement in place

### Hour 7-8: The Full Dysfunction
- Movement patterns altered
- Posture locked in dysfunction
- Energy depleted
- Pain becomes "normal"

## The 15-Minute Reset: Your Daily Antidote

This routine strategically reverses every adaptation from sitting. Do it immediately after work for best results.
